Developer Testing 
    
    1) Manual testing 
    2) A small change will impact/ introduce a bug any where in project

    3) Types of testing (for developer)
        - unit testing
        - integration testing
        - end to end testing (e2e testing)
        
        - first two will be for developer important

    4) Unit testing 
         - Test react component in isolation
         - one unit => component , only test at a time
        
    5) Integration testing 
        - multiple components involves, talk to each other, event handling involved, eg. test search feature of project

    6) e2e testing 
        - from user landing to first page to checkout his order, end to end user journy in different use case

    7) tools need to test 
    
    8) Search for react test libraries 
        for create react app may be testing library already exists in Application

        - React Testing Library (RTLb) uses JEST -> delightful JS testing Framework (simple)

    9) setup

        # npm i -D @testing-library/react
        # npm i -D jest 

        if you are using with bebel install dependancy , go to jest site and get it
            # npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
        bebel.config.js create file at root using jest site

    10) Parcel uses bebel behind scene, may be conflict above testing bebel conf. with parcel bebel conf
        so got parcel site & search JEST -> Javascript got to bebel read this 

        create .parcelrc file in root 

        this will use test bebel and no conflict will got
        this will disable default bebel transpilation

    11) in test write jest in test command and npm run test

            if no test found then test setup done successfully
